# CHIP 8 Emulator

CHIP-8 is an interpretted programming language developed by Joseph Weisbecker in the mid 70s and was initally used on the COSMAC VIP and Telmac 1800 8-bit microcomputers to make game programming easier. CHIP-8 programs are run using a CHIP-8 virtual machine.

This is a fairly complete implementation of a CHIP-8 virtual machine however there is currently no sound.
